# Representing Dionaea data in Kibana

Based on the connections table in the sqlite database

# Logstash

The Logstash configuration file reads dionaea data from a logfile generated by *dionaea-singlelogline.py*

It uses two Maxmind database GeoIPASNum.dat and GeoLiteCity.dat for geoip enrichment.

# Kibana

The Kibana dashboard holds data on the number of events and on dionaea specific data.

# Tips

* Use "geoip.full.raw" to prevent split string data 
* curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/logstash-*'
